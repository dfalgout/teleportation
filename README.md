#Problem 1: Teleportation System
You have discovered the secrets of teleportation and have several teleportation routes up and running. Each route allows instantaneous travel from one city to another. All routes are two way: if you can teleport from city A to city B, you can also teleport from city B to city A. You want to create a system to make it easier for you to answer specific questions about your network. You should assume anyone using your network wants to travel only by teleportation.

###Questions you must be able to answer:
 - What cities can I reach from city X with a maximum of N jumps?
 - Can someone get from city X to city Y?
 - Starting in city X, is it possible to travel in a loop (leave the city on one route and return on another, without traveling along the same route twice)?

Input to the program will be a list of teleportation routes, followed by a list of queries.

####Example input:
```
Washington - Baltimore
Washington - Atlanta
Baltimore - Philadelphia
Philadelphia - New York
Los Angeles - San Fransisco
San Fransisco - Oakland
Los Angeles - Oakland
Seattle - New York
Seattle - Baltimore
cities from Seattle in 1 jumps
cities from Seattle in 2 jumps
can I teleport from New York to Atlanta
can I teleport from Oakland to Atlanta
loop possible from Oakland
loop possible from Washington
```

####Example output:
```
cities from Seattle in 1 jumps: New York, Baltimore
cities from Seattle in 2 jumps: New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington
can I teleport from New York to Atlanta: yes
can I teleport from Oakland to Atlanta: no
loop possible from Oakland: yes
loop possible from Washington: no
```

####Approach
I used an **undirected cyclic graph** to store the teleportation cities and their connections.

Once the **graph** was built, I used a **Breadth First Search (BFS)** to check if teleportation is available from the source city to the destination city. The main reason for this, is because the destination city could be only 1 jump away.

To find all possible routes from a source city, constrained to number of *jumps*, I used a **Depth First Search (DFS)** approach.

Again I used **Depth First Search (DFS)** approach to check for loops (*cycles*) from a certain source city. For unique *cycles* from a source, I count the number of *leaf nodes* that are *vertices* of the source and take the difference from total number of *vertices* - if that number is less or equal to 1 then no unique *cycles* are possible.
